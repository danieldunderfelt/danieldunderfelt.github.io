Everyone knows that the rate of which new Javascript frameworks are released is hectic, to say the least. For every deprecation, there's a bunch new ones to take its place. When someone strikes gold on a new pattern that promises to change the world, there's 20 new implementations released in a short amount of time.

Many are wondering how to make sense of it all. Which one should you go with? Which one is a good time investment to learn? The open source community is brimming with solutions to all your problems, but decision paralysis is a real thing that hurts your productivity.

You will not find the name of a single Javascript library or framework in this blogpost, not a single "this is what you should use" recommendation. A new framework, library or pattern drops almost every day, killing the previous solution. If I would name something, this post would be dead within a year.

So I won't. If you for some reason want the opinion of one guy, my previous blog posts should tell you pretty clearly what my recommendations would be.

What you will find, however, is a handful of criteria that you can apply to a (`var solution = ["framework", "library", "pattern"]`) solution.

I should also say that this is geared towards solutions for *serious apps that are going into production*. In other words, I want to help you be productive with real work. If you are just hacking around and trying stuff out; do try everything and don't worry about my criteria.

Without further ado, here's how I choose what to use, learn and fanatically preach:
