Superpowers? Why is my site called "Develop Superpowers"?

As developers, we control computers. Increasingly, computers control the world. By extension, one can arrive to the conclusion that developers control the world. As far as the real world goes, it doesn't really get any more superpowered than that.

Once you get the hang of programming, everything is within the realm of possibility. Wanna make a virtual world? Sure! Want to give computers intelligence and autonomous agency? Go for it!

Once you start thinking about it, programming is a superpower.

### Do you have a superiority complex?

Certainly not! I am but a lowly web developer, my skills extend as far as making stuff happen in your browser. I've been at it for five-ish years, so I'm definitely not the best. I have mad respect for those who brave the unhospitable worlds "near the metal", working with Assembly, C and processor software. Those people really do have superpowers. Not to mention the pioneers who started out with a napkin.

No, I don't have superpowers.

Yet! Programming is a life-long endeavour. There's always new stuff to learn. If you get bored, well, pick up another language!
